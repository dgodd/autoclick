# AutoClick

AutoClick is useful when playing games (eg. Roblox) in which you need to
constantly click. By running AutoClick, clicking "c" 4 times will toggle a mode
in which a click is initiated every 1/2 a second.

You can download the current [release](https://github.com/dgodd/autoclick/releases) and then unzip and place in
the /Applications/ directory on your mac.
